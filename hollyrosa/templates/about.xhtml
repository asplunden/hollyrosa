    <h1>About Hollyrosa</h1>
    <p style="font-size:140%"><i>Hollyrosa</i> is a program booking system built for <i>the program crew</i> at the <a href="http://www.vassaro.nu">Vässarö</a> Scout Centre. The original purpose of Hollyrosa is to handle all program bookings for the eight week summer season but is evolving to handle the whole year and also handling staff, course and group data for general booking and scheduling. <i>Hollyrosa</i> is designed to enhance communication and visualization. 
    <i>Hollyrosa</i> was first tested in the summer of 2010 and that first fligth was very successfull, we now have three and a half years of experience running it behind us. Most of what we learned has been incorporated for the summer of 2014 edition of <i>Hollyrosa</i> currently in use.</p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>There is (only in Swedish) a blog post briefly discussing usage at <a href="http://asplunden.org/guldkant/instruktioner/enkel-manual-for-bokningssystemet/">Enkel manual för bokningssystemet</a> and there is also a screencast on how to use the system.</p>
    <h2>Bug Reports</h2>
    <p>We don't have any bugs worth mentioning, but if we had, we would use the github bug tracker.</p>
    <h2>Technology and Thanks</h2>
<img alt="TG2 logo" src="images/under_the_hood_blue.png"/> 
    <p><i>Hollyrosa</i> uses the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org">Turbogears2</a> (TG2) mega framework for building database backed websites. <a href="http://python.org">In Python</a>. It contains a bunch of frameworks you don't want to miss. Especially not SQLAlchemy. </p>
    <p><i>Hollyrosa</i> uses the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> JavaScript framework for a lot of dynamic action.</p>
    <p>The database is <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> (it used to be either SQLite or MySQL. SQLAlchemy handles both and a few more I haven't tested.)</p>
    <h3>Company Support</h3>
    <p>The Hollyrosa project has recieved support from two companies which we will not mention unless they want to be mentioned, the support has been in the form of work-on-company-time and we are very greatfull for it. Thanks.</p>
    <h2>Developers</h2>
    <h3>Lead Developer and Designer</h3>
    <p>Hollyrosa is originally concieved and developed by Martin Eliasson, he is kind of resident program manager at Vässarö for the second half of the summer season. Martin has been codeing since Amiga's ruled, which has lead to a proffessional career as solutions architet and developer currently as a consultant. If your timing is good, his guns might be for hire.</p>
    <p>It also happens that Martin makes music. And party. But that's another story.</p>
    <p>Oh, and theres a few blogs and sites he runs too: <a href="http://asplunden/guldkant/">Guldkant</a></p>
    <h3>Developers</h3>

    <p>Thanks to <i>Lasse</i> for taking on integration work of vodb group data.</p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Thanks to <i>Jossan</i> for patiently testing the system for real, when the wings were so fragile others were afraid to try, you did it cheerfully.</p>
    <p>Thanks to <i>Mackan</i> for inputing more data into the system than any other user without a single complaint.</p>
