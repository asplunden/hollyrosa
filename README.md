## Synopsis

Hollyrosa is a special developed program booking system for a scout centre called Vässarö. It's tailore made for Vässarö, the culture and the ways we do things. For example, all program
are free for groups at the island, so the system has no support whatsover for billing which otherwise is quite common.

The system is built on Turbogears2 and is a little bit odd in that it uses CouchDB 1.x as backend. 

## Motivation

This project exist to make it possible for more kids and youth to have a great summer and scout experience. It also exists to enable our goal to empower young people, it does so by the single
fact that it makes progeram booking distributed and so our young staff can handle the system and we old program people can just monitor and check that all looks ok.

## Installation

Basically, you install it as a Turbogears2 app. You will also need to use the hollyrosa_viewtool to upload views to your CouchDB database.
